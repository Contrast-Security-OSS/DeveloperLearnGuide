## Overview 
<br/>

An attacker may be able to use this vulnerability to create a specific URL. If this is then visited by different user, the browser will open a WebSocket connection to a URL that is under the attacker's control.


The impact of such may lead to the attacker being able to capture sensitive data from the userâ€™s browser.
The attacker also has the potential to conduct client-side attacks against the user. 

## How To Fix  
<br/>
The most effective method of stopping WebSocket poisoning is to avoid allowing data from any untrusted source to dynamically set the target URL of a WebSocket connection. 

Additionally, always use `JSON.parse()` to safely parse JSON response data.
